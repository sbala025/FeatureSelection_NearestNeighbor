# FeatureSelection_NearestNeighbor

## Implementing Intro
Using Scanner I get the number of features and decide which algorithm to use based of user.

## Implementing Part 1 - Greedy Search Algorithms
<ins>Forward Slection</ins>: Perform a forward selection search algorithm for feature selection, gradually building up a set of selected features based on their individual evaluation scores using randomization.

Files:
* Part1/ForwardSelection.java

Functions:
* searchForwardSelection(int)
* evaluateFeatureNum (List)

<ins>Backward Elimination</ins>: Perform a backward elimination search algorithm for feature selection, gradually reducing a set of selected features based on their individual evaluation scores using randomization.

Files:
* Part1/BackwardElimination.java

Functions:
* searchbackwardElimination(int)
* evaluateFeatureNum (List)
