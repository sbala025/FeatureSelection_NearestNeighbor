# FeatureSelection_NearestNeighbor

## Implementing Intro
Using Scanner I get the number of features and decide which algorithm to use based of user.

## Implementing Part 1 - Greedy Search Algorithms
Forward Slection: Perform a forward selection search algorithm for feature selection, gradually building up a set of selected features based on their individual evaluation scores using randomization.
